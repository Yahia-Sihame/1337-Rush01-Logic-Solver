# Rush01 - Logic Puzzle Solver (C)

## 🏆 Achievement
* **Ranked 1st** at 1337 Benguerir (42 Network).
* **Ranked 2nd Nationally** across 1337 Morocco campuses.

## 📝 Description
This project is a logic puzzle solver based on the "Skyscrapers" game rules. The goal is to fill a 4x4 grid with heights (1 to 4) such that they satisfy the visibility constraints provided as input (clues from top, bottom, left, and right).

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently explores possible grid configurations to find the unique solution.
* **Input Validation**: Robust handling of clues and edge cases.
* **Low-Level C**: Written in pure C, respecting the strict Norminette rules of 42.

## 🛠️ Skills Learned
* Advanced Logic & Problem Solving.
* Recursive Programming (Backtracking).
* Team Collaboration under extreme time pressure (Rush).
